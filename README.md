# node-nlp-test1
A test of the NaturalNode package in javascript. This package seems to be more promising that the others for JS.


To test, first cd into the directory and install dependencies with:
```
npm install should
npm install csv-parse
npm install natural
npm install csv-parse
```

Then run:
```
node index.js
```
